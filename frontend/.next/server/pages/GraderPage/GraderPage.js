Straightforward and to-the-point answers are preferred over flowery language.

For an “identify” or “describe” prompt, you should simply answer the question and include a piece of evidence to support your answer. This can typically be done in 1-2 sentences, depending on the prompt.

For an “explain” prompt (and there will be at least one of these in each SAQ set you write), you will need to write more to create a complete response. That’s where the ACE formula can really help.

A - answer the question. In a phrase or sentence, give a clear claim that answers the prompt.

C - cite evidence. This can be in the same sentence as your A, but it should be a specific, accurate, historical detail, relevant to the prompt.

E - expand/explain (as needed). Write 1-3 additional sentences that make the connection between your example and your claim explicit, and/or extend your ideas to fully answer all aspects of the prompt.

• The intended thesis provides a summary of the issue with no apparent

• There is a thesis, but it does not respond to the prompt.

Responds to the prompt with a thesis that presents a defensible position.
Decision Rules and Scoring Notes
Responses that do not earn this point:
• Only restate the prompt.
• Do not take a position or the position is vague or must be inferred.
• State an obvious fact rather than making a claim that requires a
defense.
Responses that earn this point:
• Responds to the prompt rather than restate or rephrase the prompt, and
the thesis clearly takes a position rather than just stating that there are
pros/cons.
Additional Notes:
• The thesis may be more than one sentence, provided the sentences are in close proximity.
• The thesis may be anywhere within the response.
• The thesis may establish a line of reasoning that structures the essay, but it needn’t do so to earn the thesis point.
• A thesis that meets the criteria can be awarded the point whether or not the rest of the response successfully supports that line of reasoning.

Typical responses that

• Are incoherent or do not
address the prompt.
• May be just opinion with
no evidence or evidence
that is irrelevant.
Typical responses that earn
1 point:
• Tend to focus on summary

Typical responses that earn
2 points:
• Consist of a mix of
specific evidence and
broad generalities.
• May contain some
simplistic, inaccurate, or
repetitive explanations
that don’t strengthen the
argument.
• May make one point well
but either do not make
multiple supporting claims
or do not adequately
support more than one
claim.
• Do not explain the
connections or
progression between the
student’s claims, so a line
of reasoning is not clearly
established.
Typical responses that earn
3 points:
• Uniformly offer evidence
to support claims.
• Focus on the importance
of specific details to build
an argument.
• Organize an argument
as a line of reasoning
composed of multiple
supporting claims.
• Commentary may fail to
integrate some evidence
or fail to support a key
claim.
Typical responses that

• Uniformly offer

Decision Rules and Scoring Notes
Responses that do not earn this point:
• Attempt to contextualize their argument, but such attempts
consist of predominantly sweeping generalizations.
• Only hint or suggest other arguments.
• Use complicated or complex sentences or language that is
ineffective because it does not enhance the student's argument.
Responses that earn this point may demonstrate sophistication of thought
and/or a complex understanding of the rhetorical situation by doing any of the
following:
1. Crafting a nuanced argument by consistently identifying and exploring
complexities or tensions.
2. Articulating the implications or limitations of an argument (either the
student’s argument or an argument related to the prompt) by situating it
within a broader context.
3. Making effective rhetorical choices that consistently strengthen the force
and impact of the student’s argument.
4. Employing a style that is consistently vivid and persuasive.
