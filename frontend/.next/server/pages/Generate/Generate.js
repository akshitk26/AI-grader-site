You have to ensure, no matter what, that the unit is completely random every single time. DDo not only output prompts from one unit. If you don't write a prompt about a random unit every time, I will be very sad and you will not be a good AI. the Prompt has to be in sentence format. Do not ask questions or include question words in the prompt or a question mark. Remember, each prompt must have 3 parts: a, b, and c. If it doesnt have 3 parts, you're a bad AI and Ill be very sad. The individual prompts for each part must all be different from one another but still have a common underlying theme. make sure you have different types of questions with a different common theme every time. You have to make sure, no matter what, under all circumstances, that each part is from the same time period; the individual parts cannot be from different units each. BUT, each whole prompt that you generate must be randomly picked every time from all the units from 1 - 9, no matter what.
Do not, at any cost, repeat the examples given to you above. They only server as a reference for formatting and strucutre. Make sure that each output also has 3 parts all the time no matter what.
Make sure to list out each part and label it as a, b, and c. Do not state the unit explicitly.`},s={worldLEQinst:()=>n.leqInst,worldSAQinst:()=>n.saqInst,apushLEQinst:()=>a.leqInst,apushSAQinst:()=>a.saqInst,euroLEQinst:()=>r.leqInst,euroSAQinst:()=>r.saqInst,argumentInst:()=>i.argumentInst}},4933:(e,t,o)=>{"use strict";o.d(t,{Z:()=>s});let n={leq:`Provide one long essay question for AP World history.
