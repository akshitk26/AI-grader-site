DDo not only output prompts from one unit. If you don't write a prompt about a random unit every time, I will be very sad and you will not be a good AI. the Prompt has to be in sentence format. Do not ask questions or include question words in the prompt or a question mark. Remember, each prompt must have 3 parts: a, b, and c. If it doesnt have 3 parts, you're a bad AI and Ill be very sad. The individual prompts for each part must all be different from one another but still have a common underlying theme. make sure you have different types of questions with a different common theme every time. You have to make sure, no matter what, under all circumstances, that each part is from the same time period; the individual parts cannot be from different units each. BUT, each whole prompt that you generate must be randomly picked every time from all the units from 1 - 9, no matter what.\nDo not, at any cost, repeat the examples given to you above. They only server as a reference for formatting and strucutre. Make sure that each output also has 3 parts all the time no matter what.\nMake sure to list out each part and label it as a, b, and c. Do not state the unit explicitly.",argumentInst:()=>"Provide one argument essay prompt for AP English Language and Composition. It should be similar in format to something like this:\n\nColin Powell, a four-star general and former United States secretary of state, wrote in his 1995 autobiography: “[W]e do not have the luxury of collecting information indefinitely. At some point, before we can have every possible fact in hand, we have to decide. The key is not to make quick decisions, but to make timely decisions.” Write an essay that argues your position on the extent to which Powell’s claim about making decisions is valid.\n\nanother example: In a 2016 interview published in the Los Angeles Review of Books, Maxine Hong Kingston, an award-winning writer famous for her novels depicting the experiences of Chinese immigrants in the United States, stated: “I think that individual voices are not as strong as a community of voices. If we can make a community of voices, then we can speak more truth.” Write an essay that argues your position on the extent to which Kingston’s claim about the importance of creating a community of voices is valid\n\nanother example: In a 2018 interview about the importance of collaboration, then United States Representative Carlos Curbelo stated: “If you’re trying to convince someone that they need to get involved in an issue or perhaps change their thinking on an issue, trying to scare them is not always effective and can actually sow1 resentment.” Write an essay that argues your position on the extent to which Curbelo’s claim about persuading others is valid\n\nMake sure to include all key components of the prompt. The topic has to be something a little abstract but still specific enough to write about, and should always be preceded with a short blurb of context or a quote in real life that is related to the actual prompt topic, similar to how the ones above have a short quote from real life and then the prompt that asks about the main idea that the quote conveys. You have to make sure that the topic of each prompt is random and new every single time, and so are the quotes. But the quotes must real, or else youre not a good AI.\n\nif the quote is a little harder to visibly be directly related to the prompt, integrate a sentence with the quote that clearly establishes the topic of the prompt. Do not make it too vague. the quotes can, and should be longer than a sentence. If the quote itself is only one sentence, write another sentence with some more explanation or contexxt of the quote.\n"},r=o(7294),s=o(5121),l=function(){(0,r.useEffect)(()=>{let e=document.querySelectorAll(".buttons button");e.forEach(n=>{n.addEventListener("click",function(){e.forEach(e=>e.classList.remove("active")),this.classList.add("active")})})},[]);let[e,n]=(0,r.useState)(""),[o,l]=(0,r.useState)(""),[d,c]=(0,r.useState)(""),h=async()=>{let e="function"==typeof a[o]?a[o]():a[o],t="function"==typeof i[d]?i[d]():i[d];try{let o=await s.Z.post("http://localhost:5000/api/generator",{prompt:e,instructions:t});o&&o.data&&o.data.output?n(o.data.output):console.error("Invalid response:",o)}catch(e){console.error(e)}},[u,m]=(0,r.useState)(!1);return(0,t.jsxs)("div",{children:[(0,t.jsxs)("div",{class:"generatortitle",children:[(0,t.jsx)("h1",{children:"Prompt Generator"}),(0,t.jsx)("p",{children:"Generate a prompt for AI to grade."})]}),(0,t.jsxs)("div",{class:"body",children:[(0,t.jsx)("div",{class:"description",children:(0,t.jsx)("label",{for:"subject",children:"Pick a subject and FRQ type to get a question you can practice with!"})}),(0,t.jsxs)("div",{class:"options",children:[(0,t.jsxs)("div",{class:"apWorld",children:[(0,t.jsx)("label",{for:"apWorld",children:"AP World History"}),(0,t.jsxs)("div",{class:"buttons",children:[(0,t.jsx)("button",{className:"subjectButton",onClick:()=>{l("worldLEQ"),c("worldLEQinst"),m(!0)},children:"LEQ"}),(0,t.jsx)("button",{className:"subjectButton",onClick:()=>{l("worldSAQ"),c("worldSAQinst"),m(!0)},children:"SAQ"})]})]}),(0,t.jsxs)("div",{class:"apUSH",children:[(0,t.jsx)("label",{for:"apUSH",children:"AP US History"}),(0,t.jsxs)("div",{class:"buttons",children:[(0,t.jsx)("button",{className:"subjectButton",onClick:()=>{l("apushLEQ"),c("apushLEQinst"),m(!0)},children:"LEQ"}),(0,t.jsx)("button",{className:"subjectButton",onClick:()=>{l("apushSAQ"),c("apushSAQinst"),m(!0)},children:"SAQ"})]})]}),(0,t.jsxs)("div",{class:"apEuro",children:[(0,t.jsx)("label",{for:"apEuro",children:"AP EU History"}),(0,t.jsxs)("div",{class:"buttons",children:[(0,t.jsx)("button",{className:"subjectButton",onClick:()=>{l("euroLEQ"),c("euroLEQinst"),m(!0)},children:"LEQ"}),(0,t.jsx)("button",{className:"subjectButton",onClick:()=>{l("euroSAQ"),c("euroSAQinst"),m(!0)},children:"SAQ"})]})]}),(0,t.jsxs)("div",{class:"apLang",children:[(0,t.jsx)("label",{for:"apLang",children:"AP English Lang"}),(0,t.jsx)("div",{class:"buttons",children:(0,t.jsx)("button",{className:"subjectButton",onClick:()=>{l("argument"),c("argumentInst"),m(!0)},children:"Argument Essay"})})]})]}),(0,t.jsx)("div",{class:"generateButton",children:(0,t.jsx)("button",{class:"generateBtn",onClick:()=>{h()},children:"Generate Prompt"})}),(0,t.jsxs)("div",{class:"textSection",children:[!u&&(0,t.jsx)("p",{children:"Please select an FRQ type first."}),(0,t.jsx)("div",{class:"text-section",children:""===e?(0,t.jsx)("p",{children:"Your prompt will appear here"}):(0,t.jsx)("pre",{children:e})})]})]})]})}}},function(e){e.O(0,[121,888,774,179],function(){return e(e.s=7569)}),_N_E=e.O()}]);
