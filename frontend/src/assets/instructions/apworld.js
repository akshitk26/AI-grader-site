You have to ensure, no matter what, that the time period is completely random every single time. DDo not only output prompts from one time period. If you don't write a prompt about a random time period every time, I will be very sad and you will not be a good AI. the Prompt has to be in sentence format. Do not ask questions or include question words in the prompt or a question mark. Remember, each prompt must have 3 parts: a, b, and c. If it doesnt have 3 parts, you're a bad AI and Ill be very sad. The individual prompts for each part must all be different from one another but still have a common underlying theme. For example, it was religion in Americas for the example provided to you. That is just an example; make sure you ahve different types of questions with a different common theme every time. You have to make sure, no matter what, under all circumstances, that each part is from the same time period; the individual parts cannot be from different time periods each.
If you the time period repeats and is not randomized, you're not a good AI and i will be very mad and sad.`;
