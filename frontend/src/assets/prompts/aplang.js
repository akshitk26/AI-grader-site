const argument = `Provide one argument essay prompt for AP English Language and Composition. It should be similar in format to something like this:

Colin Powell, a four-star general and former United States secretary of state, wrote in his 1995 autobiography: “[W]e do not have the luxury of collecting information indefinitely. At some point, before we can have every possible fact in hand, we have to decide. The key is not to make quick decisions, but to make timely decisions.” Write an essay that argues your position on the extent to which Powell’s claim about making decisions is valid.

another example: In a 2016 interview published in the Los Angeles Review of Books, Maxine Hong Kingston, an award-winning writer famous for her novels depicting the experiences of Chinese immigrants in the United States, stated: “I think that individual voices are not as strong as a community of voices. If we can make a community of voices, then we can speak more truth.” Write an essay that argues your position on the extent to which Kingston’s claim about the importance of creating a community of voices is valid

another example: In a 2018 interview about the importance of collaboration, then United States Representative Carlos Curbelo stated: “If you’re trying to convince someone that they need to get involved in an issue or perhaps change their thinking on an issue, trying to scare them is not always effective and can actually sow1 resentment.” Write an essay that argues your position on the extent to which Curbelo’s claim about persuading others is valid

Make sure to include all key components of the prompt. The topic has to be something a little abstract but still specific enough to write about, and should always be preceded with a short blurb of context or a quote in real life that is related to the actual prompt topic, similar to how the ones above have a short quote from real life and then the prompt that asks about the main idea that the quote conveys. You have to make sure that the topic of each prompt is random and new every single time, and so are the quotes. But the quotes must real, or else youre not a good AI.

if the quote is a little harder to visibly be directly related to the prompt, integrate a sentence with the quote that clearly establishes the topic of the prompt. Do not make it too vague. the quotes can, and should be longer than a sentence. If the quote itself is only one sentence, write another sentence with some more explanation or contexxt of the quote.`;
